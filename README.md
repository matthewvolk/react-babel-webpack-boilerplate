## Usage

Bare bones React.js skeleton for quick React setups. 

```bash
1. $ npm start        // Runs webpack dev server development mode
```

### Explanation: 
Uses Webpack as a module bundler and build tool. Also uses webpack-dev-server to serve the bundled app in a local environment. The 'start' script above runs webpack-dev-server using the webpack.config file in the root directory. Webpack.config includes the configuration rules for Babel, supporting ES6 + ESNext. 

### Planned:
SASS support, Jest test suite
